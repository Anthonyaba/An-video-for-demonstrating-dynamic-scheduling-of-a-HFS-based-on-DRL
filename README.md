This repository is used to store a video file. The video simply demonstrates the application of AnyLogic to the dynamic scheduling problem of a hybrid flow shop, including: 1. Initialization; 2. Estimate the completion time of jobs; 3. Internal state design of multiple agents; 4. Custom creation of AnyLogic simulation engine and DRL training process.
